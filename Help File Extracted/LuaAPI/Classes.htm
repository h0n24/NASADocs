			Classes</h1>
		<p>
            A class can be a <a href="../Addons/Libraries.htm">library</a> or an <a href="../Addons/Objects.htm">object</a> or both. There can be enums, <a href="../Addons/Events.htm">events</a>, functions or methods associated with a class. 
		</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Enums are pre-defined constants used with the class name with the following way: ClassName.CodeEnumSetName.CodeEnumItem1</li>
            <li>Functions are like "static functions" used with the class name with the following way: ClassName.Function()</li>
            <li>Methods are used with an instance of the class (say oObject, usually returned by another function/method) in the following way: oObject:Method()</li>
        </ul>
